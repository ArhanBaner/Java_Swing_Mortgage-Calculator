# Mortgage-Calculator

## Introduction

This simple Java program combines a normal calculator with an optional mortgage payment option. In addition, the entire project is programmed using Java Swing GUI and the user can click on the buttons just as they would on any digital calculator.

The mortgage calculator has the option of either outputting the monthly amount required or the total amount paid. This choice can be selected with a button on the application. Since the calculator works independantly, both of them can be used simultaneously for your needs.

Feel free to download and use it for your own use. As always, any sugggestions are welcome and greatly appreciated!
